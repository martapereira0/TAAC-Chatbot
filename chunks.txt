4 Position of the European Parliament of 13 March 2024.
Whereas:
(1) The purpose of this Regulation is to improve the functioning of the internal market by
laying down a uniform legal framework in particular for the development, the placing on
the market, the putting into service and the use of artificial intelligence systems (AI
systems) in the Union, in accordance with Union values, to promote the uptake of human
----------------------------------------
Chunk 6:
the market, the putting into service and the use of artificial intelligence systems (AI
systems) in the Union, in accordance with Union values, to promote the uptake of human
centric and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) while ensuring a high level of
protection of health, safety, fundamental rights as enshrined in the Charter of
Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’), including democracy, the
rule of law and environmental protection, to protect against the harmful effects of AI
systems in the Union, and to support innovation. This Regulation ensures the free
movement, cross-border, of AI-based goods and services, thus preventing Member States
from imposing restrictions on the development, marketing and use of AI systems, unless
explicitly authorised by this Regulation.
(2) This Regulation should be applied in accordance with the values of the Union enshrined
as in the Charter, facilitating the protection of natural persons, undertakings,
----------------------------------------
Chunk 7:
(2) This Regulation should be applied in accordance with the values of the Union enshrined
as in the Charter, facilitating the protection of natural persons, undertakings,
democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection, while boosting innovation and
employment and making the Union a leader in the uptake of trustworthy AI.
(3) ▌ AI systems ▌ can be easily deployed in a large variety of sectors of the economy and
many parts of society, including across borders, and can easily circulate throughout the
Union. Certain Member States have already explored the adoption of national rules to
ensure that AI is trustworthy and safe and is developed and used in accordance with
fundamental rights obligations. Diverging national rules may lead to the fragmentation of
the internal market and may decrease legal certainty for operators that develop, import or
use AI systems. A consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union should
----------------------------------------
Chunk 8:
the internal market and may decrease legal certainty for operators that develop, import or
use AI systems. A consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union should
therefore be ensured in order to achieve trustworthy AI, while divergences hampering the
free circulation, innovation, deployment and the uptake of AI systems and related
products and services within the internal market should be prevented by laying down
uniform obligations for operators and guaranteeing the uniform protection of overriding
reasons of public interest and of rights of persons throughout the internal market on the
basis of Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). To
the extent that this Regulation contains specific rules on the protection of individuals with
regard to the processing of personal data concerning restrictions of the use of AI systems
for remote biometric identification for the purpose of law enforcement, of the use of AI
----------------------------------------
Chunk 9:
regard to the processing of personal data concerning restrictions of the use of AI systems
for remote biometric identification for the purpose of law enforcement, of the use of AI
systems for risk assessments of natural persons for the purpose of law enforcement and
of the use of AI systems of biometric categorisation for the purpose of law enforcement, it
is appropriate to base this Regulation, in so far as those specific rules are concerned, on
Article 16 TFEU. In light of those specific rules and the recourse to Article 16 TFEU, it is
appropriate to consult the European Data Protection Board.
(4) AI is a fast evolving family of technologies that contributes to a wide array of economic,
environmental and societal benefits across the entire spectrum of industries and social
activities. By improving prediction, optimising operations and resource allocation, and
personalising digital solutions available for individuals and organisations, the use of AI can

Chunk 10:
activities. By improving prediction, optimising operations and resource allocation, and
personalising digital solutions available for individuals and organisations, the use of AI can
provide key competitive advantages to undertakings and support socially and
environmentally beneficial outcomes, for example in healthcare, agriculture, food safety,
education and training, media, sports, culture, infrastructure management, energy,
transport and logistics, public services, security, justice, resource and energy efficiency,
environmental monitoring, the conservation and restoration of biodiversity and
ecosystems and climate change mitigation and adaptation.
(5) At the same time, depending on the circumstances regarding its specific application, use,
and level of technological development, AI may generate risks and cause harm to public
interests and fundamental rights that are protected by Union law. Such harm might be
----------------------------------------
Chunk 11:
and level of technological development, AI may generate risks and cause harm to public
interests and fundamental rights that are protected by Union law. Such harm might be
material or immaterial, including physical, psychological, societal or economic harm.
(6) Given the major impact that AI can have on society and the need to build trust, it is vital
for AI and its regulatory framework to be developed in accordance with Union values as
enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), the fundamental rights
and freedoms enshrined in the Treaties and, pursuant to Article 6 TEU, the Charter. As
a pre-requisite, AI should be a human-centric technology. It should serve as a tool for
people, with the ultimate aim of increasing human well-being.
(7) In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of public interests as regards
health, safety and fundamental rights, common rules for high-risk AI systems should be
----------------------------------------
Chunk 12:
(7) In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of public interests as regards
health, safety and fundamental rights, common rules for high-risk AI systems should be
established. Those rules should be consistent with the Charter, non-discriminatory and
in line with the Union’s international trade commitments. They should also take into
account the European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles for the Digital
Decade and the Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI of the High-Level Expert Group on
Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG).
(8) A Union legal framework laying down harmonised rules on AI is therefore needed to foster
the development, use and uptake of AI in the internal market that at the same time meets a
high level of protection of public interests, such as health and safety and the protection of
fundamental rights, including democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection
----------------------------------------
Chunk 13:
high level of protection of public interests, such as health and safety and the protection of
fundamental rights, including democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection
as recognised and protected by Union law. To achieve that objective, rules regulating the
placing on the market, the putting into service and the use of certain AI systems should be
laid down, thus ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market and allowing those
systems to benefit from the principle of free movement of goods and services. Those rules
should be clear and robust in protecting fundamental rights, supportive of new
innovative solutions, enabling a European ecosystem of public and private actors
creating AI systems in line with Union values and unlocking the potential of the digital
transformation across all regions of the Union. By laying down those rules as well as
measures in support of innovation with a particular focus on small and medium
----------------------------------------
Chunk 14:
transformation across all regions of the Union. By laying down those rules as well as
measures in support of innovation with a particular focus on small and medium
enterprises (SMEs), including startups, this Regulation supports the objective of
promoting the European human-centric approach to AI and being a global leader in the
development of secure, trustworthy and ethical AI ▌ as stated by the European Council5,
and it ensures the protection of ethical principles, as specifically requested by the European
Parliament6.

technologies, 2020/2012(INL).
(9) Harmonised rules applicable to the placing on the market, the putting into service and the
use of high-risk AI systems should be laid down consistently with Regulation (EC) No
765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council7, Decision No 768/2008/EC of
the European Parliament and of the Council8 and Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the
European Parliament and of the Council9 (New Legislative Framework). The harmonised
rules laid down in this Regulation should apply across sectors and, in line with the New
Legislative Framework, should be without prejudice to existing Union law, in particular
on data protection, consumer protection, fundamental rights, employment, and
protection of workers, and product safety, to which this Regulation is complementary.

Chunk 16:
7 Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008
setting out the requirements for accreditation and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 339/93
(OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 30).
8 Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on
a common framework for the marketing of products, and repealing Council Decision
93/465/EEC (OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 82).
9 Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019
on market surveillance and compliance of products and amending Directive 2004/42/EC and
Regulations (EC) No 765/2008 and (EU) No 305/2011 (OJ L 169, 25.6.2019, p. 1).
As a consequence, all rights and remedies provided for by such Union law to consumers,
and other persons on whom AI systems may have a negative impact, including as
regards the compensation of possible damages pursuant to Council Directive
----------------------------------------
Chunk 17:
and other persons on whom AI systems may have a negative impact, including as
regards the compensation of possible damages pursuant to Council Directive
85/374/EEC10 remain unaffected and fully applicable. Furthermore, in the context of
employment and protection of workers, this Regulation should therefore not affect
Union law on social policy and national labour law, in compliance with Union law,
concerning employment and working conditions, including health and safety at work
and the relationship between employers and workers. This Regulation should also not
affect the exercise of fundamental rights as recognised in the Member States and at
Union level, including the right or freedom to strike or to take other action covered by
the specific industrial relations systems in Member States as well as the right to
negotiate, to conclude and enforce collective agreements or to take collective action in
accordance with national law.
----------------------------------------
Chunk 18:
negotiate, to conclude and enforce collective agreements or to take collective action in
accordance with national law.
10 Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws,
regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for
defective products (OJ L 210, 7.8.1985, p. 29).
This Regulation should not affect the provisions aiming to improve working conditions
in platform work laid down in a Directive of the European Parliament and of the
Council on improving working conditions in platform work. Moreover, this Regulation
aims to strengthen the effectiveness of such existing rights and remedies by establishing
specific requirements and obligations, including in respect of the transparency, technical
documentation and record-keeping of AI systems. Furthermore, the obligations placed
on various operators involved in the AI value chain under this Regulation should apply
----------------------------------------
Chunk 19:
documentation and record-keeping of AI systems. Furthermore, the obligations placed
on various operators involved in the AI value chain under this Regulation should apply
without prejudice to national law, in compliance with Union law, having the effect of
limiting the use of certain AI systems where such law falls outside the scope of this
Regulation or pursues legitimate public interest objectives other than those pursued by
this Regulation. For example, national labour law and law on the protection of minors,
namely persons below the age of 18, taking into account the UNCRC General Comment
No 25 (2021) on children’s rights in relation to the digital environment, insofar as they
are not specific to AI systems and pursue other legitimate public interest objectives,
should not be affected by this Regulation.
(10) The fundamental right to the protection of personal data is safeguarded in particular by
Regulations (EU) 2016/67911 and (EU) 2018/172512 of the European Parliament and of

Chunk 20:
(10) The fundamental right to the protection of personal data is safeguarded in particular by
Regulations (EU) 2016/67911 and (EU) 2018/172512 of the European Parliament and of
the Council and Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the
Council13. Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council14
additionally protects private life and the confidentiality of communications, including by
way of providing conditions for any storing of personal and non-personal data in, and
access from, terminal equipment. Those Union legal acts provide the basis for
sustainable and responsible data processing, including where data sets include a mix of
personal and non-personal data. This Regulation does not seek to affect the application
of existing Union law governing the processing of personal data, including the tasks and
powers of the independent supervisory authorities competent to monitor compliance with
those instruments.

11 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016
on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the
free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection
Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1).
12 Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October
2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by
the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data,
and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295,

It also does not affect the obligations of providers and deployers of AI systems in their
role as data controllers or processors stemming from Union or national law on the
protection of personal data in so far as the design, the development or the use of AI
systems involves the processing of personal data. It is also appropriate to clarify that
data subjects continue to enjoy all the rights and guarantees awarded to them by such
Union law, including the rights related to solely automated individual decision-making,
including profiling. Harmonised rules for the placing on the market, the putting into
service and the use of AI systems established under this Regulation should facilitate the
effective implementation and enable the exercise of the data subjects’ rights and other
remedies guaranteed under Union law on the protection of personal data and of other
fundamental rights.
----------------------------------------
Chunk 24:
effective implementation and enable the exercise of the data subjects’ rights and other
remedies guaranteed under Union law on the protection of personal data and of other
fundamental rights.
(11) This Regulation should be without prejudice to the provisions regarding the liability of
providers of intermediary services as set out in Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the
European Parliament and of the Council15.
15 Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 October
2022 on a Single Market For Digital Services and amending Directive 2000/31/EC (Digital
Services Act) (OJ L 277, 27.10.2022, p. 1).
(12) The notion of ‘AI system’ in this Regulation should be clearly defined and should be
closely aligned with the work of international organisations working on AI to ensure
legal certainty, facilitate international convergence and wide acceptance, while providing
the flexibility to accommodate the rapid technological developments in this field.
----------------------------------------
Chunk 25:
legal certainty, facilitate international convergence and wide acceptance, while providing
the flexibility to accommodate the rapid technological developments in this field.
Moreover, the definition should be based on key characteristics of AI systems that
distinguish it from simpler traditional software systems or programming approaches and
should not cover systems that are based on the rules defined solely by natural persons to
automatically execute operations. A key characteristic of AI systems is their capability to
infer. This capability to infer refers to the process of obtaining the outputs, such as
predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions, which can influence physical and
virtual environments, and to a capability of AI systems to derive models or algorithms, or
both, from inputs or data. The techniques that enable inference while building an AI
system include machine learning approaches that learn from data how to achieve certain
----------------------------------------
Chunk 26:
both, from inputs or data. The techniques that enable inference while building an AI
system include machine learning approaches that learn from data how to achieve certain
objectives, and logic- and knowledge-based approaches that infer from encoded
knowledge or symbolic representation of the task to be solved. The capacity of an AI
system to infer transcends basic data processing by enabling learning, reasoning or
modelling. The term ‘machine-based’ refers to the fact that AI systems run on machines.
The reference to explicit or implicit objectives underscores that AI systems can operate
according to explicit defined objectives or to implicit objectives. The objectives of the AI
system may be different from the intended purpose of the AI system in a specific context.
For the purposes of this Regulation, environments should be understood to be the
contexts in which the AI systems operate, whereas outputs generated by the AI system
----------------------------------------
Chunk 27:
For the purposes of this Regulation, environments should be understood to be the
contexts in which the AI systems operate, whereas outputs generated by the AI system
reflect different functions performed by AI systems and include predictions, content,
recommendations or decisions. AI systems are designed to operate with varying levels of
autonomy, meaning that they have some degree of independence of actions from human
involvement and of capabilities to operate without human intervention. The adaptiveness
that an AI system could exhibit after deployment, refers to self-learning capabilities,
allowing the system to change while in use. AI systems can be used on a stand-alone
basis or as a component of a product, irrespective of whether the system is physically
integrated into the product (embedded) or serves the functionality of the product without
being integrated therein (non-embedded).
(13) The notion of ‘deployer’ referred to in this Regulation should be interpreted as any
----------------------------------------
Chunk 28:
being integrated therein (non-embedded).
(13) The notion of ‘deployer’ referred to in this Regulation should be interpreted as any
natural or legal person, including a public authority, agency or other body, using an AI
system under its authority, except where the AI system is used in the course of a personal
non-professional activity. Depending on the type of AI system, the use of the system may
affect persons other than the deployer.
(14) The notion of ‘biometric data’ used in this Regulation ▌ should be interpreted in light of
the notion of biometric data as defined in Article 4, point (14) of Regulation (EU)
2016/679, Article 3, point (18) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and Article 3, point (13) of
Directive (EU) 2016/680. Biometric data can allow for the authentication, identification
or categorisation of natural persons and for the recognition of emotions of natural
persons.
(15) The notion of ‘biometric identification’ referred to in this Regulation should be defined
----------------------------------------
Chunk 29:
or categorisation of natural persons and for the recognition of emotions of natural
persons.
(15) The notion of ‘biometric identification’ referred to in this Regulation should be defined
as the automated recognition of physical, physiological and behavioural human features
such as the face, eye movement, body shape, voice, prosody, gait, posture, heart rate,
blood pressure, odour, keystrokes characteristics, for the purpose of establishing an
individual’s identity by comparing biometric data of that individual to stored biometric
data of individuals in a reference database, irrespective of whether the individual has
given its consent or not. This excludes AI systems intended to be used for biometric
verification, which includes authentication, whose sole purpose is to confirm that a
specific natural person is the person he or she claims to be and to confirm the identity of
a natural person for the sole purpose of having access to a service, unlocking a device or
----------------------------------------
Chunk 30:
specific natural person is the person he or she claims to be and to confirm the identity of
a natural person for the sole purpose of having access to a service, unlocking a device or
having security access to premises.
(16) The notion of ‘biometric categorisation’ referred to in this Regulation should be defined
as assigning natural persons to specific categories on the basis of their biometric data.
Such specific categories can relate to aspects such as sex, age, hair colour, eye colour,
tattoos, behavioural or personality traits, language, religion, membership of a national
minority, sexual or political orientation. This does not include biometric categorisation
systems that are a purely ancillary feature intrinsically linked to another commercial
service, meaning that the feature cannot, for objective technical reasons, be used without
the principal service, and the integration of that feature or functionality is not a means
----------------------------------------
Chunk 31:
service, meaning that the feature cannot, for objective technical reasons, be used without
the principal service, and the integration of that feature or functionality is not a means
to circumvent the applicability of the rules of this Regulation. For example, filters
categorising facial or body features used on online marketplaces could constitute such
an ancillary feature as they can be used only in relation to the principal service which
consists in selling a product by allowing the consumer to preview the display of the
product on him or herself and help the consumer to make a purchase decision. Filters
used on online social network services which categorise facial or body features to allow
users to add or modify pictures or videos could also be considered to be ancillary feature
as such filter cannot be used without the principal service of the social network services
consisting in the sharing of content online.
----------------------------------------
Chunk 32:
as such filter cannot be used without the principal service of the social network services
consisting in the sharing of content online.
(17) The notion of ‘remote biometric identification system’ referred to in this Regulation should
be defined functionally, as an AI system intended for the identification of natural persons
without their active involvement, typically at a distance, through the comparison of a
person’s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database,
irrespectively of the particular technology, processes or types of biometric data used.
Such remote biometric identification systems are typically used to perceive multiple
persons or their behaviour simultaneously in order to facilitate significantly the
identification of natural persons without their active involvement. This excludes AI
systems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, the
----------------------------------------
Chunk 33:
identification of natural persons without their active involvement. This excludes AI
systems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, the
sole purpose of which is to confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she
claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of
having access to a service, unlocking a device or having security access to premises.
That exclusion is justified by the fact that such systems are likely to have a minor impact
on fundamental rights of natural persons compared to the remote biometric
identification systems which may be used for the processing of the biometric data of a
large number of persons without their active involvement. In the case of ‘real-time’
systems, the capturing of the biometric data, the comparison and the identification occur all
instantaneously, near-instantaneously or in any event without a significant delay. In this
----------------------------------------
Chunk 34:
systems, the capturing of the biometric data, the comparison and the identification occur all
instantaneously, near-instantaneously or in any event without a significant delay. In this
regard, there should be no scope for circumventing the rules of this Regulation on the ‘real-
time’ use of the AI systems concerned by providing for minor delays. ‘Real-time’ systems
involve the use of ‘live’ or ‘near-live’ material, such as video footage, generated by a
camera or other device with similar functionality. In the case of ‘post’ systems, in contrast,
the biometric data has already been captured and the comparison and identification occur
only after a significant delay. This involves material, such as pictures or video footage
generated by closed circuit television cameras or private devices, which has been generated
before the use of the system in respect of the natural persons concerned.

before the use of the system in respect of the natural persons concerned.
(18) The notion of ‘emotion recognition system’ referred to in this Regulation should be
defined as an AI system for the purpose of identifying or inferring emotions or
intentions of natural persons on the basis of their biometric data. The notion refers to
emotions or intentions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust,
embarrassment, excitement, shame, contempt, satisfaction and amusement. It does not
include physical states, such as pain or fatigue, including, for example, systems used in
detecting the state of fatigue of professional pilots or drivers for the purpose of
preventing accidents. This does also not include the mere detection of readily apparent
expressions, gestures or movements, unless they are used for identifying or inferring
emotions. Those expressions can be basic facial expressions, such as a frown or a smile,
----------------------------------------
Chunk 36:
expressions, gestures or movements, unless they are used for identifying or inferring
emotions. Those expressions can be basic facial expressions, such as a frown or a smile,
or gestures such as the movement of hands, arms or head, or characteristics of a
person’s voice, such as a raised voice or whispering.
(19) For the purposes of this Regulation the notion of ‘publicly accessible space’ should be
understood as referring to any physical space that is accessible to an undetermined
number of natural persons, and irrespective of whether the space in question is privately
or publicly owned, irrespective of the activity for which the space may be used, such as
for commerce, for example, shops, restaurants, cafés; for services, for example, banks,
professional activities, hospitality; for sport, for example, swimming pools, gyms,
stadiums; for transport, for example, bus, metro and railway stations, airports, means of

Chunk 37:
professional activities, hospitality; for sport, for example, swimming pools, gyms,
stadiums; for transport, for example, bus, metro and railway stations, airports, means of
transport; for entertainment, for example, cinemas, theatres, museums, concert and
conference halls; or for leisure or otherwise, for example, public roads and squares,
parks, forests, playgrounds. A space should also be classified as being publicly accessible
if, regardless of potential capacity or security restrictions, access is subject to certain
predetermined conditions which can be fulfilled by an undetermined number of persons,
such as the purchase of a ticket or title of transport, prior registration or having a certain
age. In contrast, a space should not be considered to be publicly accessible if access is
limited to specific and defined natural persons through either Union or national law
directly related to public safety or security or through the clear manifestation of will by

Chunk 38:
limited to specific and defined natural persons through either Union or national law
directly related to public safety or security or through the clear manifestation of will by
the person having the relevant authority over the space. The factual possibility of access
alone, such as an unlocked door or an open gate in a fence, does not imply that the space
is publicly accessible in the presence of indications or circumstances suggesting the
contrary, such as. signs prohibiting or restricting access. Company and factory premises,
as well as offices and workplaces that are intended to be accessed only by relevant
employees and service providers, are spaces that are not publicly accessible. Publicly
accessible spaces should not include prisons or border control. Some other spaces may
comprise both publicly accessible and non-publicly accessible spaces, such as the
hallway of a private residential building necessary to access a doctor's office or an

Chunk 39:
comprise both publicly accessible and non-publicly accessible spaces, such as the
hallway of a private residential building necessary to access a doctor's office or an
airport. Online spaces are not covered, as they are not physical spaces. Whether a given
space is accessible to the public should however be determined on a case-by-case basis,
having regard to the specificities of the individual situation at hand.
(20) In order to obtain the greatest benefits from AI systems while protecting fundamental
rights, health and safety and to enable democratic control, AI literacy should equip
providers, deployers and affected persons with the necessary notions to make informed
decisions regarding AI systems. Those notions may vary with regard to the relevant
context and can include understanding the correct application of technical elements
during the AI system’s development phase, the measures to be applied during its use, the
----------------------------------------
Chunk 40:
context and can include understanding the correct application of technical elements
during the AI system’s development phase, the measures to be applied during its use, the
suitable ways in which to interpret the AI system’s output, and, in the case of affected
persons, the knowledge necessary to understand how decisions taken with the assistance
of AI will have an impact on them. In the context of the application this Regulation, AI
literacy should provide all relevant actors in the AI value chain with the insights
required to ensure the appropriate compliance and its correct enforcement.
Furthermore, the wide implementation of AI literacy measures and the introduction of
appropriate follow-up actions could contribute to improving working conditions and
ultimately sustain the consolidation, and innovation path of trustworthy AI in the Union.
The European Artificial Intelligence Board (the ‘Board’) should support the
----------------------------------------
Chunk 41:
ultimately sustain the consolidation, and innovation path of trustworthy AI in the Union.
The European Artificial Intelligence Board (the ‘Board’) should support the
Commission, to promote AI literacy tools, public awareness and understanding of the
benefits, risks, safeguards, rights and obligations in relation to the use of AI systems. In
cooperation with the relevant stakeholders, the Commission and the Member States
should facilitate the drawing up of voluntary codes of conduct to advance AI literacy
among persons dealing with the development, operation and use of AI.
(21) In order to ensure a level playing field and an effective protection of rights and freedoms of
individuals across the Union, the rules established by this Regulation should apply to
providers of AI systems in a non-discriminatory manner, irrespective of whether they are
established within the Union or in a third country, and to deployers of AI systems
established within the Union.
----------------------------------------
Chunk 42:
established within the Union or in a third country, and to deployers of AI systems
established within the Union.
(22) In light of their digital nature, certain AI systems should fall within the scope of this
Regulation even when they are not placed on the market, put into service, or used in the
Union. This is the case, for example, where an operator established in the Union contracts
certain services to an operator established in a third country in relation to an activity to be
performed by an AI system that would qualify as high-risk ▌ . In those circumstances, the
AI system used in a third country by the operator could process data lawfully collected in
and transferred from the Union, and provide to the contracting operator in the Union the
output of that AI system resulting from that processing, without that AI system being
placed on the market, put into service or used in the Union. To prevent the circumvention
----------------------------------------
Chunk 43:
output of that AI system resulting from that processing, without that AI system being
placed on the market, put into service or used in the Union. To prevent the circumvention
of this Regulation and to ensure an effective protection of natural persons located in the
Union, this Regulation should also apply to providers and deployers of AI systems that are
established in a third country, to the extent the output produced by those systems is
intended to be used in the Union.
Nonetheless, to take into account existing arrangements and special needs for future
cooperation with foreign partners with whom information and evidence is exchanged, this
Regulation should not apply to public authorities of a third country and international
organisations when acting in the framework of cooperation or international agreements
concluded at Union or national level for law enforcement and judicial cooperation with the
Union or the Member States, provided that the relevant third country or international
----------------------------------------
Chunk 44:
concluded at Union or national level for law enforcement and judicial cooperation with the
Union or the Member States, provided that the relevant third country or international
organisation provides adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of fundamental
rights and freedoms of individuals. Where relevant, this may cover activities of entities
entrusted by the third countries to carry out specific tasks in support of such law
enforcement and judicial cooperation. Such framework for cooperation or agreements
have been established bilaterally between Member States and third countries or between
the European Union, Europol and other Union agencies and third countries and
international organisations. The authorities competent for supervision of the law
enforcement and judicial authorities under this Regulation should assess whether those
frameworks for cooperation or international agreements include adequate safeguards
----------------------------------------
Chunk 45:
enforcement and judicial authorities under this Regulation should assess whether those
frameworks for cooperation or international agreements include adequate safeguards
with respect to the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals.
Recipient national authorities and Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies
making use of such outputs in the Union remain accountable to ensure their use
complies with Union law. When those international agreements are revised or new ones
are concluded in the future, the contracting parties should make utmost efforts to align
those agreements with the requirements of this Regulation.
(23) This Regulation should also apply to Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies when
acting as a provider or deployer of an AI system. ▌
(24) If, and insofar as, AI systems are placed on the market, put into service, or used with or
without modification of such systems for military, defence or national security purposes,
----------------------------------------
Chunk 46:
(24) If, and insofar as, AI systems are placed on the market, put into service, or used with or
without modification of such systems for military, defence or national security purposes,
those should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation regardless of which type of
entity is carrying out those activities, such as whether it is a public or private entity. As
regards military and defence purposes, such exclusion is justified both by Article 4(2)
TEU and by the specificities of the Member States’ and the common Union defence
policy covered by Chapter 2 of Title V TEU that are subject to public international law,
which is therefore the more appropriate legal framework for the regulation of AI
systems in the context of the use of lethal force and other AI systems in the context of
military and defence activities. As regards national security purposes, the exclusion is
justified both by the fact that national security remains the sole responsibility of Member
----------------------------------------
Chunk 47:
military and defence activities. As regards national security purposes, the exclusion is
justified both by the fact that national security remains the sole responsibility of Member
States in accordance with Article 4(2) TEU and by the specific nature and operational
needs of national security activities and specific national rules applicable to those
activities. Nonetheless, if an AI system developed, placed on the market, put into service
or used for military, defence or national security purposes is used outside those
temporarily or permanently for other purposes, for example, civilian or humanitarian
purposes, law enforcement or public security purposes, such a system would fall within
the scope of this Regulation.
In that case, the entity using the AI system for other than military, defence or national
security purposes should ensure the compliance of the AI system with this Regulation,
unless the system is already compliant with this Regulation. AI systems placed on the
----------------------------------------
Chunk 48:
security purposes should ensure the compliance of the AI system with this Regulation,
unless the system is already compliant with this Regulation. AI systems placed on the
market or put into service for an excluded purpose, namely military, defence or national
security, and one or more non-excluded purposes, such as civilian purposes or law
enforcement, fall within the scope of this Regulation and providers of those systems
should ensure compliance with this Regulation. In those cases, the fact that an AI
system may fall within the scope of this Regulation should not affect the possibility of
entities carrying out national security, defence and military activities, regardless of the
type of entity carrying out those activities, to use AI systems for national security,
military and defence purposes, the use of which is excluded from the scope of this
Regulation. An AI system placed on the market for civilian or law enforcement purposes
----------------------------------------
Chunk 49:
military and defence purposes, the use of which is excluded from the scope of this
Regulation. An AI system placed on the market for civilian or law enforcement purposes
which is used with or without modification for military, defence or national security
purposes should not fall within the scope of this Regulation, regardless of the type of
entity carrying out those activities.
(25) This Regulation should support innovation, should respect freedom of science, and
should not undermine research and development activity. It is therefore necessary to
exclude from its scope AI systems and models specifically developed and put into service
for the sole purpose of scientific research and development. Moreover, it is necessary to
ensure that this Regulation does not otherwise affect scientific research and
development activity on AI systems or models prior to being placed on the market or put
into service. As regards product-oriented research, testing and development activity
----------------------------------------
Chunk 50:
development activity on AI systems or models prior to being placed on the market or put
into service. As regards product-oriented research, testing and development activity
regarding AI systems or models, the provisions of this Regulation should also not apply
prior to those systems and models being put into service or placed on the market. That
exclusion is without prejudice to the obligation to comply with this Regulation where an
AI system falling into the scope of this Regulation is placed on the market or put into
service as a result of such research and development activity and to the application of
provisions on AI regulatory sandboxes and testing in real world conditions.
Furthermore, without prejudice to the exclusion of AI systems specifically developed and
put into service for the sole purpose of scientific research and development, any other AI
system that may be used for the conduct of any research and development activity should
----------------------------------------
Chunk 51:
put into service for the sole purpose of scientific research and development, any other AI
system that may be used for the conduct of any research and development activity should
remain subject to the provisions of this Regulation. In any event, any research and
development activity should be carried out in accordance with recognised ethical and
professional standards for scientific research and should be conducted in accordance
with applicable Union law.
(26) In order to introduce a proportionate and effective set of binding rules for AI systems, a
clearly defined risk-based approach should be followed. That approach should tailor the
type and content of such rules to the intensity and scope of the risks that AI systems can
generate. It is therefore necessary to prohibit certain unacceptable AI practices, to lay
down requirements for high-risk AI systems and obligations for the relevant operators, and
to lay down transparency obligations for certain AI systems.
----------------------------------------
Chunk 52:
down requirements for high-risk AI systems and obligations for the relevant operators, and
to lay down transparency obligations for certain AI systems.
(27) While the risk-based approach is the basis for a proportionate and effective set of
binding rules, it is important to recall the 2019 Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI
developed by the independent AI HLEG appointed by the Commission. In those
guidelines, the AI HLEG developed seven non-binding ethical principles for AI which
are intended to help ensure that AI is trustworthy and ethically sound. The seven
principles include human agency and oversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy
and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal
and environmental well-being and accountability. Without prejudice to the legally
binding requirements of this Regulation and any other applicable Union law, those
guidelines contribute to the design of coherent, trustworthy and human-centric AI, in
----------------------------------------
Chunk 53:
binding requirements of this Regulation and any other applicable Union law, those
guidelines contribute to the design of coherent, trustworthy and human-centric AI, in
line with the Charter and with the values on which the Union is founded. According to
the guidelines of the AI HLEG, human agency and oversight means that AI systems are
developed and used as a tool that serves people, respects human dignity and personal
autonomy, and that is functioning in a way that can be appropriately controlled and
overseen by humans.
Technical robustness and safety means that AI systems are developed and used in a way
that allows robustness in the case of problems and resilience against attempts to alter the
use or performance of the AI system so as to allow unlawful use by third parties, and
minimise unintended harm. Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are
developed and used in accordance with privacy and data protection rules, while
----------------------------------------
Chunk 54:
minimise unintended harm. Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are
developed and used in accordance with privacy and data protection rules, while
processing data that meets high standards in terms of quality and integrity.
Transparency means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows
appropriate traceability and explainability, while making humans aware that they
communicate or interact with an AI system, as well as duly informing deployers of the
capabilities and limitations of that AI system and affected persons about their rights.
Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness means that AI systems are developed and
used in a way that includes diverse actors and promotes equal access, gender equality
and cultural diversity, while avoiding discriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are
prohibited by Union or national law. Social and environmental well-being means that AI
----------------------------------------
Chunk 55:
and cultural diversity, while avoiding discriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are
prohibited by Union or national law. Social and environmental well-being means that AI
systems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as
well as in a way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-
term impacts on the individual, society and democracy. The application of those
principles should be translated, when possible, in the design and use of AI models. They
should in any case serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under this
Regulation. All stakeholders, including industry, academia, civil society and
standardisation organisations, are encouraged to take into account, as appropriate, the
ethical principles for the development of voluntary best practices and standards.
(28) Aside from the many beneficial uses of AI, it can also be misused and provide novel and
----------------------------------------
Chunk 56:
ethical principles for the development of voluntary best practices and standards.
(28) Aside from the many beneficial uses of AI, it can also be misused and provide novel and
powerful tools for manipulative, exploitative and social control practices. Such practices
are particularly harmful and abusive and should be prohibited because they contradict
Union values of respect for human dignity, freedom, equality, democracy and the rule of
law and fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, including the right to non-
discrimination, to data protection and to privacy and the rights of the child.
(29) AI-enabled manipulative techniques can be used to persuade persons to engage in
unwanted behaviours, or to deceive them by nudging them into decisions in a way that
subverts and impairs their autonomy, decision-making and free choices. The placing on
the market, the putting into service or the use of certain AI systems with the objective to or
----------------------------------------
Chunk 57:
subverts and impairs their autonomy, decision-making and free choices. The placing on
the market, the putting into service or the use of certain AI systems with the objective to or
the effect of materially distorting human behaviour, whereby significant harms, in
particular having sufficiently important adverse impacts on physical, psychological
health or financial interests are likely to occur, are particularly dangerous and should
therefore be prohibited. Such AI systems deploy subliminal components such as audio,
image, video stimuli that persons cannot perceive, as those stimuli are beyond human
perception, or other manipulative or deceptive techniques that subvert or impair person’s
autonomy, decision-making or free choice in ways that people are not consciously aware
of those techniques or, where they are aware of them, can still be deceived or are not
able to control or resist them. This could be facilitated, for example, by machine-brain

Chunk 58:
of those techniques or, where they are aware of them, can still be deceived or are not
able to control or resist them. This could be facilitated, for example, by machine-brain
interfaces or virtual reality as they allow for a higher degree of control of what stimuli
are presented to persons, insofar as they may materially distort their behaviour in a
significantly harmful manner. In addition, AI systems may also otherwise exploit the
vulnerabilities of a person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability within
the meaning of Directive (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the
Council16, or a specific social or economic situation that is likely to make those persons
more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme poverty, ethnic or
religious minorities.
16 Directive (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on

16 Directive (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on
the accessibility requirements for products and services (OJ L 151, 7.6.2019, p. 70).
Such AI systems can be placed on the market, put into service or used with the objective
to or the effect of materially distorting the behaviour of a person and in a manner that
causes or is reasonably likely to cause significant harm to that or another person or groups
of persons, including harms that may be accumulated over time and should therefore be
prohibited. It may not be possible to assume that there is an intention to distort behaviour
where the distortion ▌ results from factors external to the AI system which are outside the
control of the provider or the deployer, namely factors that may not be reasonably
foreseeable and therefore not possible for the provider or the deployer of the AI system
----------------------------------------
Chunk 60:
control of the provider or the deployer, namely factors that may not be reasonably
foreseeable and therefore not possible for the provider or the deployer of the AI system
to mitigate. In any case, it is not necessary for the provider or the deployer to have the
intention to cause significant harm, provided that such harm results from the
manipulative or exploitative AI-enabled practices. The prohibitions for such AI practices
are complementary to the provisions contained in Directive 2005/29/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council17, in particular unfair commercial practices leading to
economic or financial harms to consumers are prohibited under all circumstances,
irrespective of whether they are put in place through AI systems or otherwise. The
prohibitions of manipulative and exploitative practices in this Regulation should not
affect lawful practices in the context of medical treatment such as psychological
----------------------------------------
Chunk 61:
prohibitions of manipulative and exploitative practices in this Regulation should not
affect lawful practices in the context of medical treatment such as psychological
treatment of a mental disease or physical rehabilitation, when those practices are carried
out in accordance with the applicable law and medical standards, for example explicit
consent of the individuals or their legal representatives. In addition, common and
legitimate commercial practices, for example in the field of advertising, that comply with
the applicable law should not, in themselves, be regarded as constituting harmful
manipulative AI-enabled practices.

(30) Biometric categorisation systems that are based on natural persons’ biometric data, such
as an individual person’s face or fingerprint, to deduce or infer an individuals’ political
opinions, trade union membership, religious or philosophical beliefs, race, sex life or
sexual orientation should be prohibited. That prohibition should not cover the lawful
labelling, filtering or categorisation of biometric data sets acquired in line with Union or
national law according to biometric data, such as the sorting of images according to hair
colour or eye colour, which can for example be used in the area of law enforcement.

(31) AI systems providing social scoring of natural persons ▌ by public or private actors may
lead to discriminatory outcomes and the exclusion of certain groups. They may violate the
right to dignity and non-discrimination and the values of equality and justice. Such AI
systems evaluate or classify natural persons or groups thereof on the basis of multiple
data points related to their social behaviour in multiple contexts or known, inferred or
predicted personal or personality characteristics over certain periods of time. The social
score obtained from such AI systems may lead to the detrimental or unfavourable
treatment of natural persons or whole groups thereof in social contexts, which are unrelated
to the context in which the data was originally generated or collected or to a detrimental
treatment that is disproportionate or unjustified to the gravity of their social behaviour. AI

Chunk 64:
to the context in which the data was originally generated or collected or to a detrimental
treatment that is disproportionate or unjustified to the gravity of their social behaviour. AI
systems entailing such unacceptable scoring practices and leading to such detrimental or
unfavourable outcomes should therefore be prohibited. That prohibition should not affect
lawful evaluation practices of natural persons that are carried out for a specific purpose
in accordance with Union and national law.
(32) The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is particularly intrusive to
the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the
private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and
indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights.
----------------------------------------
Chunk 65:
private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and
indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights.
Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of
natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. Such
possible biased results and discriminatory effects are particularly relevant with regard to
age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the
limited opportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems
operating in real-time carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms of the persons
concerned in the context of, or impacted by, law enforcement activities.

Chunk 66:
(33) The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be
prohibited, except in exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where the use is
strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which
outweighs the risks. Those situations involve the search for certain victims of crime ▌
including missing persons; certain threats to the life or to the physical safety of natural
persons or of a terrorist attack; and the localisation or identification of perpetrators or
suspects of the criminal offences listed in an annex to this Regulation, where those
criminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or
a detention order for a maximum period of at least four years and as they are defined in the
law of that Member State. Such a threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in
accordance with national law contributes to ensuring that the offence should be serious

Chunk 67:
law of that Member State. Such a threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in
accordance with national law contributes to ensuring that the offence should be serious
enough to potentially justify the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems.
Moreover, the list of criminal offences provided in an annex to this Regulation is based
on the 32 criminal offences listed in the Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA18,
taking into account that some of those offences are, in practice, likely to be more relevant
than others, in that the recourse to ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification could,
foreseeably, be necessary and proportionate to highly varying degrees for the practical
pursuit of the localisation or identification of a perpetrator or suspect of the different
criminal offences listed and having regard to the likely differences in the seriousness,
probability and scale of the harm or possible negative consequences. An imminent threat
----------------------------------------
Chunk 68:
criminal offences listed and having regard to the likely differences in the seriousness,
probability and scale of the harm or possible negative consequences. An imminent threat
to life or the physical safety of natural persons could also result from a serious
disruption of critical infrastructure, as defined in Article 2, point (4) of Directive (EU)
2022/2557 of the European Parliament and of the Council19, where the disruption or
destruction of such critical infrastructure would result in an imminent threat to life or
the physical safety of a person, including through serious harm to the provision of basic
supplies to the population or to the exercise of the core function of the State. In addition,
this Regulation should preserve the ability for law enforcement, border control,
immigration or asylum authorities to carry out identity checks in the presence of the
person concerned in accordance with the conditions set out in Union and national law
----------------------------------------
Chunk 69:
immigration or asylum authorities to carry out identity checks in the presence of the
person concerned in accordance with the conditions set out in Union and national law
for such checks. In particular, law enforcement, border control, immigration or asylum
authorities should be able to use information systems, in accordance with Union or
national law, to identify persons who, during an identity check, either refuse to be
identified or are unable to state or prove their identity, without being required by this
Regulation to obtain prior authorisation. This could be, for example, a person involved
in a crime, being unwilling, or unable due to an accident or a medical condition, to
disclose their identity to law enforcement authorities.

(34) In order to ensure that those systems are used in a responsible and proportionate manner, it
is also important to establish that, in each of those exhaustively listed and narrowly defined
situations, certain elements should be taken into account, in particular as regards the nature
of the situation giving rise to the request and the consequences of the use for the rights and
freedoms of all persons concerned and the safeguards and conditions provided for with the
use. In addition, the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly

freedoms of all persons concerned and the safeguards and conditions provided for with the
use. In addition, the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly
accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be deployed only to confirm
the specifically targeted individual’s identity and should be limited to what is strictly
necessary concerning the period of time, as well as the geographic and personal scope,
having regard in particular to the evidence or indications regarding the threats, the victims
or perpetrator. The use of the real-time remote biometric identification system in publicly
accessible spaces should be authorised only if the relevant law enforcement authority
has completed a fundamental rights impact assessment and, unless provided otherwise in
this Regulation, has registered the system in the database as set out in this Regulation.
The reference database of persons should be appropriate for each use case in each of the

Chunk 72:
this Regulation, has registered the system in the database as set out in this Regulation.
The reference database of persons should be appropriate for each use case in each of the
situations mentioned above.
(35) Each use of a ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible
spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be subject to an express and specific
authorisation by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority of a
Member State whose decision is binding. Such authorisation should, in principle, be
obtained prior to the use of the AI system with a view to identifying a person or persons.
Exceptions to that rule should be allowed in duly justified situations on grounds of
urgency, namely in situations where the need to use the systems concerned is such as to
make it effectively and objectively impossible to obtain an authorisation before
commencing the use of the AI system. In such situations of urgency, the use of the AI

Chunk 73:
make it effectively and objectively impossible to obtain an authorisation before
commencing the use of the AI system. In such situations of urgency, the use of the AI
system should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and should be subject to
appropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national law and specified in the
context of each individual urgent use case by the law enforcement authority itself. In
addition, the law enforcement authority should in such situations request such
authorisation ▌ while providing the reasons for not having been able to request it earlier,
without undue delay and at the latest within 24 hours. If such an authorisation is
rejected, the use of real-time biometric identification systems linked to that authorisation
should cease with immediate effect and all the data related to such use should be
discarded and deleted. Such data includes input data directly acquired by an AI system
----------------------------------------
Chunk 74:
should cease with immediate effect and all the data related to such use should be
discarded and deleted. Such data includes input data directly acquired by an AI system
in the course of the use of such system as well as the results and outputs of the use
linked to that authorisation. It should not include input that is legally acquired in
accordance with another Union or national law. In any case, no decision producing an
adverse legal effect on a person should be taken based solely on the output of the remote
biometric identification system.
(36) In order to carry out their tasks in accordance with the requirements set out in this
Regulation as well as in national rules, the relevant market surveillance authority and
the national data protection authority should be notified of each use of the real-time
biometric identification system. Market surveillance authorities and the national data
protection authorities that have been notified should submit to the Commission an

Chunk 75:
biometric identification system. Market surveillance authorities and the national data
protection authorities that have been notified should submit to the Commission an
annual report on the use of real-time biometric identification systems.
(37) Furthermore, it is appropriate to provide, within the exhaustive framework set by this
Regulation that such use in the territory of a Member State in accordance with this
Regulation should only be possible where and in as far as the Member State concerned has
decided to expressly provide for the possibility to authorise such use in its detailed rules of
national law. Consequently, Member States remain free under this Regulation not to
provide for such a possibility at all or to only provide for such a possibility in respect of
some of the objectives capable of justifying authorised use identified in this Regulation.
Such national rules should be notified to the Commission within 30 days of their
adoption.
----------------------------------------
Chunk 76:
some of the objectives capable of justifying authorised use identified in this Regulation.
Such national rules should be notified to the Commission within 30 days of their
adoption.
(38) The use of AI systems for real-time remote biometric identification of natural persons in
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily involves the
processing of biometric data. The rules of this Regulation that prohibit, subject to certain
exceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should apply as lex specialis in
respect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in Article 10 of Directive
(EU) 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in
an exhaustive manner. Therefore, such use and processing should be possible only in as far
as it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope,
outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law
----------------------------------------
Chunk 77:
as it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope,
outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law
enforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the
grounds listed in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. In that context, this Regulation is
not intended to provide the legal basis for the processing of personal data under Article 8
of Directive (EU) 2016/680. However, the use of real-time remote biometric identification
systems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including
by competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such
use for the purpose of law enforcement set by this Regulation. Such use for purposes other
than law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an authorisation
under this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law that may give effect
----------------------------------------
Chunk 78:
than law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an authorisation
under this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law that may give effect
to that authorisation.
(39) Any processing of biometric data and other personal data involved in the use of AI systems
for biometric identification, other than in connection to the use of real-time remote
biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law
enforcement as regulated by this Regulation, should continue to comply with all
requirements resulting from Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. For purposes other
than law enforcement, ▌ Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 10(1) of
Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 prohibit the processing of biometric data subject to limited
exceptions as provided in those Articles. In the application of Article 9(1) of Regulation
(EU) 2016/679, the use of remote biometric identification for purposes other than law
----------------------------------------
Chunk 79:
exceptions as provided in those Articles. In the application of Article 9(1) of Regulation
(EU) 2016/679, the use of remote biometric identification for purposes other than law
enforcement has already been subject to prohibition decisions by national data
protection authorities.
(40) In accordance with Article 6a of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom
and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, as annexed to the TEU
and to the TFEU, Ireland is not bound by the rules laid down in Article 5(1), first

basis of Article 16 TFEU, or subject to their application, which relate to the processing of
personal data by the Member States when carrying out activities falling within the scope of
Chapter 4 or Chapter 5 of Title V of Part Three of the TFEU.
(42) In line with the presumption of innocence, natural persons in the Union should always
be judged on their actual behaviour. Natural persons should never be judged on AI-
predicted behaviour based solely on their profiling, personality traits or characteristics,
----------------------------------------
Chunk 82:
be judged on their actual behaviour. Natural persons should never be judged on AI-
predicted behaviour based solely on their profiling, personality traits or characteristics,
such as nationality, place of birth, place of residence, number of children, level of debt
or type of car, without a reasonable suspicion of that person being involved in a criminal
activity based on objective verifiable facts and without human assessment thereof.
Therefore, risk assessments carried out with regard to natural persons in order to assess
the likelihood of their offending or to predict the occurrence of an actual or potential
criminal offence based solely on profiling them or on assessing their personality traits
and characteristics should be prohibited. In any case, that prohibition does not refer to
or touch upon risk analytics that are not based on the profiling of individuals or on the
personality traits and characteristics of individuals, such as AI systems using risk
----------------------------------------
Chunk 83:
or touch upon risk analytics that are not based on the profiling of individuals or on the
personality traits and characteristics of individuals, such as AI systems using risk
analytics to assess the likelihood of financial fraud by undertakings on the basis of
suspicious transactions or risk analytic tools to predict the likelihood of the localisation
of narcotics or illicit goods by customs authorities, for example on the basis of known
trafficking routes.
(43) The placing on the market, the putting into service for that specific purpose, or the use
of AI systems that create or expand facial recognition databases through the untargeted
scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage, should be prohibited
because that practice adds to the feeling of mass surveillance and can lead to gross
violations of fundamental rights, including the right to privacy.
(44) There are serious concerns about the scientific basis of AI systems aiming to identify or
----------------------------------------
Chunk 84:
violations of fundamental rights, including the right to privacy.
(44) There are serious concerns about the scientific basis of AI systems aiming to identify or
infer emotions, particularly as expression of emotions vary considerably across cultures
and situations, and even within a single individual. Among the key shortcomings of such
systems are the limited reliability, the lack of specificity and the limited generalisability.
Therefore, AI systems identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons
on the basis of their biometric data may lead to discriminatory outcomes and can be
intrusive to the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons. Considering the
imbalance of power in the context of work or education, combined with the intrusive
nature of these systems, such systems could lead to detrimental or unfavourable
treatment of certain natural persons or whole groups thereof. Therefore, the placing on
----------------------------------------
Chunk 85:
nature of these systems, such systems could lead to detrimental or unfavourable
treatment of certain natural persons or whole groups thereof. Therefore, the placing on
the market, the putting into service, or the use of AI systems intended to be used to detect
the emotional state of individuals in situations related to the workplace and education
should be prohibited. That prohibition should not cover AI systems placed on the market
strictly for medical or safety reasons, such as systems intended for therapeutical use.
(45) Practices that are prohibited by Union law, including data protection law, non-
discrimination law, consumer protection law, and competition law, should not be
affected by this Regulation.
(46) High-risk AI systems should only be placed on the Union market, put into service or used
if they comply with certain mandatory requirements. Those requirements should ensure
that high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the

Chunk 86:
if they comply with certain mandatory requirements. Those requirements should ensure
that high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the
Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognised and
protected by Union law. On the basis of the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in
the Commission notice “The ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules
2022”20, the general rule is that more than one legal act of Union harmonisation
legislation, such as Regulations (EU) 2017/74521 and (EU) 2017/74622 of the European
Parliament and of the Council or Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and
of the Council23, may be applicable to one product, since the making available or putting

harmonisation legislation. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative
burdens or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI systems,
to which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonisation legislation
listed in an annex to this Regulation apply, should have flexibility with regard to
operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or
more AI systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation
in an optimal manner. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that
have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons
in the Union and such limitation should minimise any potential restriction to international
trade.

Chunk 89:
(47) AI systems could have an adverse impact on the health and safety of persons, in particular
when such systems operate as safety components of products. Consistent with the
objectives of Union harmonisation legislation to facilitate the free movement of products in
the internal market and to ensure that only safe and otherwise compliant products find their
way into the market, it is important that the safety risks that may be generated by a product
as a whole due to its digital components, including AI systems, are duly prevented and
mitigated. For instance, increasingly autonomous robots, whether in the context of
manufacturing or personal assistance and care should be able to safely operate and
performs their functions in complex environments. Similarly, in the health sector where the
stakes for life and health are particularly high, increasingly sophisticated diagnostics
systems and systems supporting human decisions should be reliable and accurate. ▌

Chunk 90:
stakes for life and health are particularly high, increasingly sophisticated diagnostics
systems and systems supporting human decisions should be reliable and accurate. ▌
(48) The extent of the adverse impact caused by the AI system on the fundamental rights
protected by the Charter is of particular relevance when classifying an AI system as high
risk. Those rights include the right to human dignity, respect for private and family life,
protection of personal data, freedom of expression and information, freedom of
assembly and of association, the right to non-discrimination, the right to education,
consumer protection, workers’ rights, the rights of persons with disabilities, gender
equality, intellectual property rights, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial,
the right of defence and the presumption of innocence, and the right to good
administration. In addition to those rights, it is important to highlight the fact that

Chunk 91:
the right of defence and the presumption of innocence, and the right to good
administration. In addition to those rights, it is important to highlight the fact that
children have specific rights as enshrined in Article 24 of the Charter and in the United
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, further developed in the UNCRC
General Comment No 25 as regards the digital environment, both of which require
consideration of the children’s vulnerabilities and provision of such protection and care
as necessary for their well-being. The fundamental right to a high level of environmental
protection enshrined in the Charter and implemented in Union policies should also be
considered when assessing the severity of the harm that an AI system can cause,
including in relation to the health and safety of persons.

Chunk 97:
(50) As regards AI systems that are safety components of products, or which are themselves
products, falling within the scope of certain Union harmonisation legislation listed in an
annex to this Regulation, it is appropriate to classify them as high-risk under this
Regulation if the product concerned undergoes the conformity assessment procedure with a
third-party conformity assessment body pursuant to that relevant Union harmonisation
legislation. In particular, such products are machinery, toys, lifts, equipment and protective
systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres, radio equipment, pressure
equipment, recreational craft equipment, cableway installations, appliances burning
gaseous fuels, medical devices, in vitro diagnostic medical devices, automotive and
aviation.
(51) The classification of an AI system as high-risk pursuant to this Regulation should not
necessarily mean that the product whose safety component is the AI system, or the AI

Chunk 98:
aviation.
(51) The classification of an AI system as high-risk pursuant to this Regulation should not
necessarily mean that the product whose safety component is the AI system, or the AI
system itself as a product, is considered to be high-risk under the criteria established in the
relevant Union harmonisation legislation that applies to the product. This is, in particular,
the case for Regulations (EU) 2017/745 and (EU) 2017/746, where a third-party
conformity assessment is provided for medium-risk and high-risk products.
(52) As regards stand-alone AI systems, namely high-risk AI systems other than those that are
safety components of products, or that are themselves products, it is appropriate to classify
them as high-risk if, in light of their intended purpose, they pose a high risk of harm to the
health and safety or the fundamental rights of persons, taking into account both the severity
of the possible harm and its probability of occurrence and they are used in a number of

Chunk 99:
health and safety or the fundamental rights of persons, taking into account both the severity
of the possible harm and its probability of occurrence and they are used in a number of
specifically pre-defined areas specified in this Regulation. The identification of those
systems is based on the same methodology and criteria envisaged also for any future
amendments of the list of high-risk AI systems that the Commission should be
empowered to adopt, via delegated acts, to take into account the rapid pace of
technological development, as well as the potential changes in the use of AI systems.
(53) It is also important to clarify that there may be specific cases in which AI systems
referred to in pre-defined areas specified in this Regulation do not lead to a significant
risk of harm to the legal interests protected under those areas because they do not
materially influence the decision-making or do not harm those interests substantially.
----------------------------------------
Chunk 100:
risk of harm to the legal interests protected under those areas because they do not
materially influence the decision-making or do not harm those interests substantially.
For the purposes of this Regulation, an AI system that does not materially influence the
outcome of decision-making should be understood to be an AI system that does not have
an impact on the substance, and thereby the outcome, of decision-making, whether
human or automated. An AI system that does not materially influence the outcome of
decision-making could include situations in which one or more of the following
conditions are fulfilled. The first such condition should be that the AI system is intended
to perform a narrow procedural task, such as an AI system that transforms unstructured
data into structured data, an AI system that classifies incoming documents into
categories or an AI system that is used to detect duplicates among a large number of
----------------------------------------
Chunk 101:
data into structured data, an AI system that classifies incoming documents into
categories or an AI system that is used to detect duplicates among a large number of
applications. Those tasks are of such narrow and limited nature that they pose only
limited risks which are not increased through the use of an AI system in a context that is
listed as a high-risk use in an annex to this Regulation. The second condition should be
that the task performed by the AI system is intended to improve the result of a previously
completed human activity that may be relevant for the purposes of the high-risk uses
listed in an annex to this Regulation. Considering those characteristics, the AI system
provides only an additional layer to a human activity with consequently lowered risk.
That condition would, for example, apply to AI systems that are intended to improve the
language used in previously drafted documents, for example in relation to professional
----------------------------------------
Chunk 102:
That condition would, for example, apply to AI systems that are intended to improve the
language used in previously drafted documents, for example in relation to professional
tone, academic style of language or by aligning text to a certain brand messaging.
The third condition should be that the AI system is intended to detect decision-making
patterns or deviations from prior decision-making patterns. The risk would be lowered
because the use of the AI system follows a previously completed human assessment
which it is not meant to replace or influence, without proper human review. Such AI
systems include for instance those that, given a certain grading pattern of a teacher, can
be used to check ex post whether the teacher may have deviated from the grading pattern
so as to flag potential inconsistencies or anomalies. The fourth condition should be that
the AI system is intended to perform a task that is only preparatory to an assessment
----------------------------------------
Chunk 103:
so as to flag potential inconsistencies or anomalies. The fourth condition should be that
the AI system is intended to perform a task that is only preparatory to an assessment
relevant for the purposes of the AI systems listed in an annex to this Regulation, thus
making the possible impact of the output of the system very low in terms of representing
a risk for the assessment to follow. That condition covers, inter alia, smart solutions for
file handling, which include various functions from indexing, searching, text and speech
processing or linking data to other data sources, or AI systems used for translation of
initial documents. In any case, AI systems used in high-risk use-cases listed in an annex
to this Regulation should be considered to pose significant risks of harm to the health,
safety or fundamental rights if the AI system implies profiling within the meaning of
Article 4, point (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Article 3, point (4) of Directive (EU)
----------------------------------------
Chunk 104:
safety or fundamental rights if the AI system implies profiling within the meaning of
Article 4, point (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Article 3, point (4) of Directive (EU)
2016/680 or Article 3, point (5) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. To ensure traceability
and transparency, a provider who considers that an AI system is not high-risk on the
basis of the conditions referred to above should draw up documentation of the
assessment before that system is placed on the market or put into service and should
provide that documentation to national competent authorities upon request. Such a
